ASSET  MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

An asset management system is the combination of technology (hardware and software) and processes and procedures that oversee the monitoring and maintenance of stocked products, whether those products are company assets, raw materials and supplies, or finished products ready to be sent to vendors or end consumers. A complete asset management system consists of:

A system for identifying every asset item and its associated information, such as barcode labels or asset tags. 
Hardware tools for reading barcode labels, such as handheld barcode scanners or smartphones with barcode scanning apps.
Asset management software, which provides a central database and point of reference for all asset, coupled with the ability to analyse data, generate reports, forecast future demand, and more.

Benefits of Asset Management Systems
Without an asset management system, the goods and products that flow through an organization will inevitably be in disarray. An asset management system enables a company to maintain a centralized record of every asset and item in the control of the organization, providing a single source of truth for the location of every item, vendor and supplier information, specifications, and the total number of a particular item currently in stock.
Because asset often consists of movable assets, asset management systems are critical for keeping tabs on current stock levels and understanding what items move quickly and which items are more slow-moving, which in turn enables organizations to determine when it’s time to reorder with greater accuracy. Overall, a comprehensive asset management system offers countless benefits to companies including:
	Improved cash flow
	Better reporting and forecasting capabilities
	Reduction in storage costs (overhead)
	Reduced labour costs
	Reduction in dead stock
	Better organization
	Enhanced transparency
	Improved supplier, vendor, and partner relationships








Why do we need an Asset Management software?
Any venture that handles stock will need a system to accurately track and control it. Without one, you’ll be working on an entirely ad-hoc basis — and you’ll quickly run into situations where your business is overstocked or understocked.
Asset systems tell you the number of components or ingredients you need to create or assemble your final product. Without this information you may end up with excess stock, eroding your bottom line, or with insufficient stock to meet customer demand.
But while you will need an asset management system, which one you choose is entirely up to you. There are countless different systems you can adopt, ranging from simple approaches to comprehensive solutions.
